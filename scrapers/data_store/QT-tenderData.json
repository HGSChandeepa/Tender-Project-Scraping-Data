    "description": "The Department of Resources (Resources) is responsible for maintaining Queensland Government’s foundation spatial data, described by the ANZLIC Foundation Spatial Data Framework (FSDF).   Resources is currently modernising the systems used to manage and maintain our spatial cadastre (under the Land Parcel and Property theme) and location addressing (under the Geocoded Addressing theme) data.  Following proof-of-concept work to explore modernisation options, Resources commissioned the development of a Solution Architecture to describe the optimal “Future State” for our spatial cadastre and location addressing management and maintenance systems.  This Request for Quote (RfQ) seeks a provider of technical system design and implementation services to support the location addressing component(s) of the Future State Solution Architecture.  Existing Environment (Current State)  Two custom systems are currently used to manage and maintain Queensland’s location address data in an Ingres (11.2) RDBMS:  PropLoc, built in .NET, is used to insert bulk location addressing data supplied in pipe delimited text format.  Nucleus, built in .NET, is used for case-by-case queries and updates of location addressing data.  Proposed Solution (Future State)  The Future State Solution Architecture provides a database model for the management and maintenance of location addressing data, and related data such as property geometries, in a new environment.   The architecture describes a highly modern, standardised semantic web-based approach to data management and maintenance, supported by an enterprise spatial system.   The solution has been designed to provide greater flexibility, scalability, and standardization to support existing and emergent requirements for the effective and efficient management and maintenance of addressing data, while enabling connectivity and interoperability with a broader set of foundation spatial data.  Briefly, the architecture describes the following fundamental system components:  Storage of location address and associated data (such as road and geographical name information) in a cloud- and RDF-based, SPARQL protocol-compliant database solution, utilising the SHACL W3C standard for RDF validation.  Spatial features (such as address geometries) associated with location addresses to be managed in an Esri ArcGIS (currently Pro 3.1.2, Enterprise 10.9.1) environment, ensuring location address queries and updates through the ArcGIS environment and UI are reflected in the database.  A Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) UI for management of location address data in a UI that does not necessarily require the visualisation of spatial components, allowing for more efficient bulk updates, simple fixes, etc.  A Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) engine for asynchronous communication of data events between systems and stores, and to enable establish of robust publish/subscribe data interactions.    The Future State Solution Architecture aligns with the recommendations of the ICSM and ANZLIC Addressing 2035 strategy, and with national and international standards.  Requirements and Scope  Ingres, PropLoc and Nucleus are to be retired, as they are no longer fit-for-purpose.   Semantic data models, an associated supermodel, and supporting vocabularies have already been established as part of the Solution Architecture design. Resources has an established Esri ArcGIS Enterprise solution deployed in an Esri-managed AWS cloud environment. Development of data models, establishment of Esri ArcGIS, and establishment of cloud architecture are not in the scope of work.  Decisions on the optimal environment, compatible with the recommendations of the Future State Solution Architecture, including the following features, have not been identified or designed:  The database supporting the environment.  The CRUD UI.  Synchronisation methodology.  The MOM engine.  The scope of this project is the design and implementation of a location addressing management and maintenance environment based on the Future State Solution Architecture, with the following characteristics and deliverables:  Identify appropriate, supportable, sustainable, cost-efficient, and effective Future State implementation options though an assessment of existing Resources environments and architectures.  Should no existing environments and architectures meet the Future State requirements, recommended options and, in agreement with Resources:  Design and implement the agreed solution.  Develop an action plan/roadmap for migration from the Current State location address data environment to the agreed Future State location address data environment.
